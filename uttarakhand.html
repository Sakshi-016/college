   <h2>Two prominent regions of Uttarakhand</h2>
   <ul>
     <strong><em>
       <li>As you plan to book Uttarakhand holiday packages, you need to read up about the two prominent regions that make up this lovely Himalayan state.</li>
       <li>Kumaon: An Uttarakhand trip is incomplete without rounding up the Kumaon region which is home to some truly fascinating sites. Munsiyari, Dharchula, Chaukori, Nainital, Pangot, Binsar, Almora, Ranikhet, Kausani, Ramgarh, Mukteshwar, make up some of the wonderful places you can explore on a Kumaoni holiday. Add to the fact that Kumaon is so well- endowed owing to its topography; the north of the region shares a border with Tibet while the east with Nepal, Uttar Pradesh lies to its southern side and Garhwal to its west, the other half of Uttarakhand</li>
       <li>Garhwal: The other significant part of Uttarakhand, Garhwal is also among the state’s most visited regions, especially thronged by pilgrims. In Haridwar, the Ganges after gushing down from the foothills passes through its many ghats before making its journey to the sea. A centre that attracts pilgrims to its famed Har-ki-Pauri ghat. Close by is Rishikesh, sky- rocketed to fame by the British rock band, Beatles in the ‘60s when they arrived in the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to seek spirituality and tranquility</li>
